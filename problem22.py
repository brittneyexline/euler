# Using names.txt, a 46K text file containing over five-thousand first names,
# begin by sorting it into alphabetical order.
# Then working out the alphabetical value for each name,
# multiply this value by its alphabetical position in the list to obtain a name score.
# For example, when the list is sorted into alphabetical order,
# COLIN, which is worth 3 + 15 + 12 + 9 + 14 = 53, is the 938th name in the list.
# So, COLIN would obtain a score of 938 Ã— 53 = 49714.
# What is the total of all the name scores in the file?
